# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this challenge is to use SQL to create two tables: 1) "retiring_ titles" table: to provide the number of retiring employees by position title in the company and 2) a table identifying those that are retiring that would be eligible for their proposed mentorship elgibility program. In the first deliverable, we created a couple tables to get the final third table. These tables included data points such as employee number, first and last name, start and end data. Subsequently, we added unique titles and with the final table of "retiring_titles" we put a number of employees retiring by unique title. As for the second deliverable, we created a table that included employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.


## Results

The first deliverable provides a table that outlines the number of retiring employees by unique title: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

The second deliverable provides a table of retiring employees that have been identified as eligible for their mentorship program: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

The four takeaways from the analyses results are as follows:

1. Nearly two-thirds of the retiring positions from our table are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff, with both roughly totaling a third of retiring employees.
2. As a result, the allocation of company resources for both both hiring and retiring should reflect that number as well. Barring any significant company strategies or trends that suggests otherwise, hiring Senior Engineers and Senior Staff should be a priority. Additionally, this will also impact the development and execution of their proposed mentorship program, which brings me to my next point.
3. Only 1,549 forthcoming retirees were identified as eligible mentors. 
4. Given the tens of thousands of forthcoming retirees, there will likely be similar numbers of new hires and therefore creating a substantial disproportion of eligible mentors and new hires. The HR department and executive will have to create mentorship program that addresses this massive gap, perhaps a mentorship program that cannot be one on one and rather a program in which a retiree mentors 10-20 new hires, at least in the case of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff.


## Summary

To address the challenge of the impending "silver tsunami," we recommend to do more rigourous analysis. For example, instead of looking at retirees by stictly by age, we can group forthcoming retirees in age buckets but also by department and position title. We would also work closely with finance to look at financial projections and trends to see what positions can go unfilled and those that need immediate attention. Additionally, with each company annual planning retreat, coupled with those that have put in their retirement papers, we can idenitfy which positions can be filled internally, as well begin hiring and recuitments programs for vacant positions and departments with the most need due to retirements. This program, along with the mentorship program, should be firmly established as a cornerstone of the company and with each passing year increase efficiency and effectiveness as a result of further analysis.  

In short, the analysis above clearly shows there are not enough eligible retirees to mentor the next generation of employees coming in. To address this disparity, we recommend in the short term that the HR department and executive team create mentorship program where the eligible retiree mentors 10-20 new hires, instead of one on one mentoring. This will especially have to be the case with Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Yes, this is not ideal, but in the long term to address this, perhaps we can do further analysis to identify ways in which we can change the eligbility criteria to create more mentors.
