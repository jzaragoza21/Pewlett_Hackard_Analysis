# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this challenge is to use SQL to create two tables: 1) "retiring_ titles" table: to provide the number of retiring employees by position title in the company and 2) a table identifying those that are retiring that would be eligible for their proposed mentorship elgibility program. In the first deliverable, we created a couple tables to get the final third table. These tables included data points such as employee number, first and last name, start and end data. Subsequently, we added unique titles and with the final table of "retiring_titles" we put a number of employees retiring by unique title. As for the second deliverable, we created a table that included employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.


## Results

The first deliverable provides a table that outlines the number of retiring employees by unique title: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

The second deliverable provides a table of retiring employees that have been identified as eligible for their mentorship program: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/jzaragoza21/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
